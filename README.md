# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-and-Alert-System-MIPS-Assembly_MARS-
This project simulates a **Driver Drowsiness Detection System** using **MIPS Assembly Language** on the **MARS simulator**.   It models real-world safety features found in modern vehicles by monitoring eye state, heart rate, steering movement, and driver's response after alert.
